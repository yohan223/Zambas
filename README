# Zambas (Python) — Core
This is a python module that contains geospatial calculations, 
these include geodetic, surveying, and GIS.
The idea of this project is to translate the original ZAMBAS code, written in BASIC,
to python to promote the use of traditional methods into a modern applications and new projects.
The code was used in an old field calculator, hence its native language being BASIC.

Read the module, and add any geospatial methods that you would like to see modernized.

Run:
  python zambas.py
(import functions from the module in your own scripts)
